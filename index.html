                                    <p><strong>Federalism</strong> is a place, combining a general government (the central or 'federal' government) with regional governments (provincial, state, cantonal, territorial or other sub - unit governments) in a single political system.<sup>1</sup>

                        <h1>What does the draft on Federalism say on<br>tax collection and fund distribution?</h1>
                        <p class="my-4">Article XIII of the Philippine Federal Constitution draft states that the Federal government has the power to collect all taxes and fees which are the following:</p>
                        <p>(a) Real Property Tax;<br>
                            (b) Estate Tax;<br>
                            (c) Donor’s Tax;<br>
                            (d) Documentary Stamp Tax;<br>
                            (e) Professional Tax;<br>
                            (f) Franchise Tax;<br>
                            (g) Games and Amusement Tax;<br>
                            (h) Environmental Tax, Pollution Tax, and similar taxes;<br>
                            (i) Road Users Tax;<br>
                            (j) Vehicle Registration Fees;<br>
                            (k) Transport Franchise Fees; and<br>
                            (l) Local taxes and other taxes which may be granted by federal law.<br>
                                </p>
                            
                        <p class="my-4">The Federal Government and the Federated Regions shall ensure that taxation shall be uniform, equitable, and progressive. Also, it is also stated in this article that <strong>Federated Regions shall be given not less than 50%</strong> of the collected income taxes, excise taxes, value-added tax, and customs duties, which will be divided equally among them and will be automatically released.</p>

                        <p class="my-4">There will also be an <strong>Equalization Fund</strong> which shall not be less than 3% of the annual General Appropriations Act. This fund shall be distributed based on the needs of the region. This prioritizes those that require support to achieve financial viability and economic sustainability as determined by the Federal Intergovernmental Commission.  </p>

                        <p class="my-4">The Congress, through the <strong>General Appropriations Act</strong>, may provide additional finances for the regions to effectively and efficiently deliver government services to their constituents.</p>

                        <h1>The effects of Federalism to tax collection<br>and fund distribution here in the Philippines</h1>
                        <p class="my-4">The following stated below were based on the summary made by the Department of Interior and Local Government Core Group on Federalism which was led by Usec. Emily O. Padilla. (File can be found <a href="http://www.dilg.gov.ph/PDF_File/reports_resources/dilg-reports-resources-2017323_186ace8e39.pdf">here</a>.)</p>
                    
                        <p class="my-4">
                            <ol>
                                <li>Government budget would be distributed equally to federal republic, avoiding the Government budget to be centralized in Manila. This will promote economic prosperity in the regions and provide incentives for Filipinos to live and work outside Metro Manila. Investors may also decide to put up their businesses by setting up the right policies.</li>
                                <li>The Equalization Fund, mentioned in Article XIII of the draft, will provide more funding and support for regions in need to accelerate their development and progress.</li>
                                <li>There will be feasible solution to the Mindanao issues - the creation of the Bangsamoro Regional Government within Federalist System will address concerns of our Muslim brothers and sisters who crave more autonomy over the Government and Administration of Muslim Mindanao.</li>
                                <li>There will be decentralization and devolution of powers. With this, more power are decentralized and devolved to local government.</li>
                                <li>With a strong political system, dynasties will become irrelevant. Political Leaders will become more accountable. No more excuses or delays in services or projects;  constituents are not forced to ask assistance from the rich in exchange for services and allegiance.</li>
                                <li>Local government can only collect real estate taxes and business permit fees. In Federalism, they can retain most of their revenue income collection and use them on programs and policies according to their needs and create enough opportunities for upward socioeconomic mobility.</li>
                                <li>Political dynasties will no longer have the ability to pass the buck to the national government and blame it for why their region is poor.</li>
                                <li>Regions will remain poor if its leaders are lousy and unable to set up pro-business economic policies that will create enough economic opportunities for the people.</li>
                                <li>No more mega-pork barrel like the PDAF.</li>
                                <li>Philippine development would attract international investors. Tax breaks would be appealing for large businesses
                                Some funds would be used to pay Philippine debt that can make the worth of peso increase.</li>

                        <h2>A. Forms of Governments</h2>
                        
                        <p><h4 style="text-align:justify !important;">Hobbes</h4></p>
                        <p>Hobbes depicted the state of nature in horrific terms: “nasty, brutish, and short” and he argued that in order to escape such horror, one strong man would rise to power (which is the Leviathan) and the people would consent to absolute political authority – because they believe that the Leviathan would be the only one who can ward off the horrific state of nature wherein everyone is at war with one another.</p>
                        <p>The fear of violent death pushes people to surrender all capacities and power to one sovereign authority, The Leviathan. Order then trumps all individual interests.</p>

                        <p>According to Hobbes "order trumps all over our individual interests" which means that we should stop being equal and create an entity with a hierarchical structure or in other words create inequality to ensure order. With federalism, this hierarchical structure would be between the federal government and regional government.</p>
                        
                        <p>Federalism also offers the decentralization of power from the President to the respective leaders of each Federated Region. This may sound contrary to the Hobbesian idea that power should be concentrated so that accountability will not be diluted, but in this way, the leaders of the Federal Region is now given majority, if not all, the power in the decision-making in their respective regional governments. Decision-making is now more monitored and controlled, that it is now easier to pinpoint who should be directly accountable to what is happening to a specific region.</p>
                        
                        <p>The regional governments should be, in reality, self-regulating since it is a form of micromanaging, however due to the numerous political dynasties in the Philippines it is hard to tell if these governments will be true to their job or return to the "state of nature".</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4 style="text-align:justify !important;">Locke</h4>
                        <p>For Locke, since men were rational, the state of nature was simply lacking in ways of enforcing what the majority of people regarded as right (life, freedom, property and ownership) hence, Locke put emphasis on creating laws in order to settle and address “uncertainties and inconveniences” regarding these. For Locke, authority wouldn’t emerge without the people’s consent. This authority would have limited powers which came from the people who surrendered part of their natural rights in exchange for protection and security. </p>
                        <p>The main point of Locke was creating laws in order to settle and address the uncertainties and inconveniences of the state. Federalism addresses this by giving power to the regional governments. In this way it is easier to address these inconveniences per region compared to addressing these inconveniences as a whole state.</p>
                                
                        <p>People now have persons to directly go to, to help them address their problems, rather than having a President who approves all decisions in the country. This can give more focus to the small problems of the citizens and attend to them in less time. This can also ensure that no or less problems will be left hanging and in idle.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4 style="text-align:justify !important;">Rousseau</h4>
                        <p>For Rousseau, natural man is a roving individual; meaning there would be no permanent relationships but a “loose companionship”; and they would neither be moral nor vicious, just innocent. For Rousseau, then, the “savage” in the state of nature was not selfish (as in Hobbes) nor even rational and altruistic (as in Locke) – for these abilities, he argued, just arose as a result of our interaction with others, especially in existing in a civilization.</p>
                        <p>With the emergence of federalism in the context of the Philippines, Rousseau will disapprove of this because one of his beliefs is that the presence and emergence of authority in a condition of inequality will bound to be corrupt. The division of labor by the regional governments is already an indication of inequality and considering the political dynasties in the Philippines, corruption may be inevitable. This will be further discussed in the next section.

                        <p>Adam Smith views people as self-interested beings but they are not self-sufficient. One does not kill another for good but engang in exchange.  The Production of goods would bring forth economic prosperity while the taxes would be given to the government ensuring the wellbeing of exchange. To Increase production specialization (division of labor) to speed up and maintain good quality.</p>
                        <p class="my-4">Philippine Federalism follows Adam Smith’s view that Producers will be the main instrument in attaining economic prosperity through Federalist pro-business programs and laws.</p>

                        <h1>Conclusion and Synthesis</h1>
                        <p class="my-4">One of the main criticisms regarding Federalism is that contrary to one if its main purposes, it wouldn't really help solve in ending corruption because in the Philippines almost 70% of Filipino politicians are connected to dynasties who have ruled towns and provinces for generations. Supposedly there's a big chance that these political dynasties will monopolize influence and wealth, thus the power is centralized only with them.</p>
                                
                        <p>It's only fair to say though, that having a federal system of government has its own merits. Ultimately, it is not the nature or the system of government that causes it to fail. The people who rule will decide whether it will fail or not. The whole culture and way of thinking must be changed in order to fully eradicate corruption and the culture of impunity from the inside. Without doing this, any form of government is doomed to fail.</p>
                        
                        <p>Jean Jacques Rousseau ultimately promoted the idea that there should be an eradication of civilization because society makes man corrupt. For him, the end goal is for humans to go back to being "noble savages". In this case, it's already 2018, and it's impossible for people to go back to being "noble savages" because the entire society is already built upon relationships with other people. But, there are other ways in order to prevent proliferation of political dynasties that serve as breeding grounds for corrupt politicians. There is no need for the eradication of the entire civilization, but address only the dynasties. For example, there is the proposed Anti-Political Dynasty bill. </p>
                        
                        <p>It’s still too early to tell whether Federalism will be the answer in addressing poverty and corruption here in the Philippines. But following Rousseau’s line of thought, since society has corrupted man, it must be eradicated. It’s impossible to go to that extreme, given our present material conditions. The best way then, is to just change the very system that perpetuates monopolization of power.
